            javaBin is open for everyone who wants to become a member. Being a paying member means that you support
            the Java community in Norway and help us organize various events throughout the year, and JavaZone.

            How much does a membership cost?
        </h3>

        <p>
            Membership in javaBin is included in the JavaZone ticket, so if you have bought a ticket to JavaZone or have received this
            from your employer, then you are already a member of javaBin for that year. If you are not going to JavaZone, you can 
            buy a separate membership. Price for this is 500 NOK for a 12-month membership. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Students with a valid student ID can apply for free membership. If you are interested in a student membership, please 
            send an email to <a href="mailto:medlemskap@java.no">medlemskap@java.no</a>.
