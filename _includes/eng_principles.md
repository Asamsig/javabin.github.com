## A few very important principles
#### Code of Conduct

javaBin aims to create a community for Java technologists in Norway that is open to all and independent of commercial interests. To make this possible, we have created the following regulations for events and activities conducted by javaBin:

* We do not tolerate any form of harassment against event participants, our members or our partners. In particular, we ask that all refrain from commentary that unnecessarily targets gender, sexual orientation, disability, race, nationality, religion or physical appearance. This applies especially but not exclusively to presented content and displayed advertisement. We also ask that all refrain from undesired contact or unwanted photography during javaBin events.
* Unless an explicit sponsorship agreement was made, active participants of javaBin events are required to represent the interest of the Java community before any commercial interest. While it is acceptable to discuss a product or a professional affiliation, advertisement must never be the focus of a participation.
Violations of these requirements can lead to expulsion from an event and, potentially, exclusion from future javaBin events. javaBin also reserves the right to withhold any refund of entrance fees or other payments and to void a membership.

#### If you observe or are affected by a violation
If you observe or are affected by a violation of the above rules, please take immediate contact with a javaBin representative (which can normally be identified as they are wearing branded clothing and/or badges). If you are accused of a violation of this regulatory and disagree with the accusation, please also get in touch. If you want to discuss a violation after an event or if you have a question about these regulations, you can email us at: styret@java.no.

In case of a violation, our primary goal is to provide support and help to those affected. A secondary goal, where applicable, will be to resolve the conflict.

In the case of disagreement in the interpretation or application of these regulations, a session of the javaBin board will rule on a case by case basis.
